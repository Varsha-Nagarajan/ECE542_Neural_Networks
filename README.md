            <ul>
            <li>Part 1: Using classic machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM and Random Forests </li>
            <li> Part 2: Using CNN-LSTM networks </li>
            </ul>
<b>Project 3 :</b> 
            <ul>
            <li>Part 1: Designing a Sequence Counter using LSTM cells </li>
            <li>Part 2: Word-level and Character-level language modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks</li>
            </ul>
<b>Capstone  :</b> Music Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks <br/>
