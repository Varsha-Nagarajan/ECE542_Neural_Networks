Project 2 : Body Rocking Behavior Recognition (Human Activity Recognition) <br/>
            <ul>
            <li>Part 1: Using classic machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM and Random Forests </li>
            <li> Part 2: Using CNN-LSTM networks </li>
            </ul></br>
Project 3 : 
            <ul>
            <li>Part 1: Designing a Sequence Counter using LSTM cells </li>
            <li>Part 2: Word-level and Character-level language modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks</li>
            </ul></br>
