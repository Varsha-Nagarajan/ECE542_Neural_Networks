# ECE542_Neural_Networks
This repository contains the projects done as part of the course ECE 542 in North Carolina State University.

The projects were as follows:

Project 1 : Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Classification
Project 2 : Body Rocking Behavior Recognition (Human Activity Recognition)
            Part 1: Using classic machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM and Random Forests.
            Part 2: Using CNN-LSTM networks
Project 3 :
            Part 1: Designing a Sequence Counter using LSTM cells
            Part 2: Word-level and Character-level language modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks
Capstone  : Music Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks
